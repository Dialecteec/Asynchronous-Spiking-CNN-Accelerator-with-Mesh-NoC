# Asynchronous-Spiking-CNN-Accelerator-with-Mesh-NoC
This project implements an asynchronous Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) integrated with a Network-on-Chip (NoC) for efficient event-driven computation. The design mimics biological neural systems by processing discrete spikes, enabling low power, low EMI, and robust asynchronous computation.

Key Features

Spiking CNN with output-stationary dataflow
Efficient reuse of input spikes and weights to reduce memory traffic.

Mesh NoC (2×3 topology)
Scalable interconnect with deterministic XY routing.

Packet-based communication
64-bit packets with hop counts, direction flags, and payload.

Processing Elements (PEs)
Gate-level bundled-data micropipeline for spiking convolution.

Verification & Testing
Gather testbench methodology for router/mesh correctness and arbitration.

Performance Analysis
Explored buffering, throughput, and critical path in bundled-data pipelines.

Technical Specs

Kernel size: 5 × 5

Input feature map: 25 × 25

Channels: 1 input, 1 output

Router: 5-port (N/S/E/W + local)

Routing: Deterministic XY

Architecture Overview

NoC: 2×3 mesh of routers connecting 5 PEs, controller, and memory.

Router: Arbitration modules with hierarchical 2-input/4-input merges.

PE: Includes packetizer/de-packetizer and spiking MAC operations.

Controller: Manages memory access, weight distribution, and synchronization.

Improvements

Reduced redundant input fetches with larger controller buffering.

Bundled-data micropipeline tested at 7 ns total latency, bottlenecked by adder array.

Future Work

Multicasting support for weight distribution.

Advanced switching (wormhole / virtual cut-through).

Error detection/correction (Hamming codes).
